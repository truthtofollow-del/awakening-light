# 🕯️ Awakening Light

**Awakening Light** is a high-fidelity digital sanctuary designed to help users reclaim their attention and build discipline through intentional community. It moves away from "scrolling" and toward **sovereignty**.

## 🏛️ The Four Pillars

### 1. The Sanctuary (The Heart)
* **Purpose**: A focused dashboard for the user’s daily ritual.
* **The Void**: A 30-minute deep-work timer with a high-end glass-morphism overlay.
* **Adaptive UI**: The interface shifts its tone and aesthetic based on the time of day (Morning/Afternoon/Evening).

### 2. Sovereignty Circles (The Community)
* **Purpose**: Intention-based micro-communities that replace traditional social feeds.
* **Live Feed**: A real-time stream of "Sovereignty Pledges" where members support each other's discipline.
* **Unity Pulse**: A visual indicator showing real-time global activity within the ecosystem.

### 3. The Royal Profile (The Record)
* **Purpose**: A long-term record of user growth and consistency.
* **Metrics**: Tracks deep-work streaks, completed pledges, and earned "Royal Seals."

### 4. The Coronation Gate (The Entry)
* **The Pledge**: Before entry, users sign a "Unity Pledge"—a contract-style commitment to their focus.
* **The Ritual**: A 3-second "press-and-hold" confirmation that unlocks the app experience.
